        <p class="em_text">It might be your first time behind the wheel, maybe you are looking to improve some of your skills through pass plus or perhaps you you are looking to regain 
        some of your confidence after a break away from driving.</p>
        <p>Either way I will help you through every step and together we can tailor your lessons to suit you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We can also arrange for alternative pick up and drop off points, so for example, if you decide to book your lesson before college, I can pick you up from home, 
        and include a route in the lesson that will drop you off at college. Or perhaps you would prefer to go later in the evening after work and you have given the kids their tea.</p>
        <p>Depending upon your requirements and availability I offer one, one and a half, or two hour lessons at various times throughout the day.</p>
        <p>I cover Bolton and surrounding areas including Astley Bridge, Bradshaw, Bromley Cross, Edgworth, Egerton, Halliwell, Harwood, Sharples, Smithills, Tonge Moor, Tottington.</p>
        <p>Give me call for a quick chat about your driving lessons on 07970 074 256 or email me with your details at

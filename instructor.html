          <p class="em_text">Would you like the freedom that being your own boss brings? Do you enjoy driving and helping people learn? If so, I am fully qualified to provide you with instructor training to help you to become a driving instructor.</p>
          <p>Before you can do this you will have to apply to the DSA. You must satisfy the Registrar that you are eligible to be a driving instructor. You will need to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>hold a full UK or European Union (EU/European Economic Area (EEA) unrestricted car driving licence;</li>
            <li>have held it for a total of at least four out of the past six years prior to entering the Register after qualifying;</li>
            <li>not have been disqualified from driving at any time in the four years prior to being entered in the Register; and</li>
            <li>be a “fit and proper” person to have your name entered in the Register. All convictions, motoring and non-motoring, will be taken into account when they assess your suitability to be entered on the Register. You also need an enhanced level criminal record bureau check (CRB).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Visit the driver trainer section on <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Drivingforaliving/Becomingadrivertrainer/index.htm">www.dsa.gov.uk</a> for further information.</p>
          <p>If you meet all the above you will then need to pass three tests:</p>
          <p>Part 1 is a theory and hazard perception test. The theory section has 100 hundred multiple choice questions, with four possible answers. You must select the correct answer and score 85% or more to pass.</p>
          <p>14 video clips make up the hazard perception element. Each clip shows one road hazard and you must press the button as soon as you see a hazard unfolding. You will get a better score the quicker you see the hazard and respond.</p>
          <p>Part 2 is a test of your driving ability. Although very similar to a standard driving test, this is over a longer duration and fewer faults are allowed.</p>
          <p>Part 3 is a test of your instructional ability. You will be required to give the examiner a numbers of ‘mock’ driving lessons each lasting 30 minutes. The lessons will be chosen by the examiner and can cover any subject. The examiner will make mistakes and ask questions, allowing them to see how you respond. They also want to know the objectives to ensure you have the ability to provide structured and beneficial lessons to students.</p>
          <p>It can take quite a long time to complete the qualifying process. However you must pass both parts two and three within two years of passing part one.  I will be here to support you every step of the way.</p>
